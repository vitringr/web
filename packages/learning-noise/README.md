# Learning Noise

The goal of this project is to help one learn how noise generation works.

- [x] [Value Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_noise)
- [x] [Gradient Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_noise)
- [ ] [Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise)
- [ ] [Worley Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise)

**Optimization**: The noise algorithms here are not necessarily optimized for performance. They are optimized for clarity and visualization.
