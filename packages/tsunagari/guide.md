# Quadtree Centers of Mass

Visualize each center of mass with a depth variable.

# Delta Time

Use delta time to remove framerate dependence.

# Equilibrium Cheat

The trick is to apply continuous drag that eventually stops the simulation.

On user input, reset and start over.

This creates the illusion of perfect equilibrium.

# Optimization

Finish the project first, then optimize!

- Remove `sqrt()` functions where it's possible.
- Replace `forEach` loops with classic ones.
- Reduce and reuse `context` setters.
