# Debug Paradigm

Start with creating great debug code, then proceed with actual logic.

## Pointer Probe

Probe (Node) following the cursor that can output its velocity vector.

Proceed with multiple node interactions after this is done.

## Quadtree Centers of Mass

Visualize each center of mass with a depth variable.

# Delta Time

Use delta time to remove framerate dependence.

# Optimization

Finish the project first, then optimize!

- Remove `sqrt()` functions where it's possible.
- Replace `forEach` loops with classic ones.
- Reduce and reuse `context` setters.
